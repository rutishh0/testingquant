retrieving balances for specific tokens by providing a token contract
address.

**Good** **Alignment.** Both systems use a block identifier to retrieve
block information.

**Transaction** **Data**

Get **Misalignment.** Overledger can retrieve a transaction using only
transaction /block/transactionits ID. Mesh **requires** **both** **the**

creating a dependency and potential friction.

**Read** **Smart** **Contract**

**Component**

**Mesh** **API** **Specification**

**Description**

An **OpenAPI** **3.0** **specification** that defines a universal set of
RESTful endpoints, data models, and communication patterns for all
blockchain interactions. This is the "contract" for the standard.

A service that implements the Mesh API for a *specific* blockchain. It
acts as a translator, **Implementation** converting the standardized
Mesh API calls into the native RPC calls of the target blockchain

**Blockchain** **Node**

**Developer** **Tooling**

**Deployment** **Model**

A full node of the target DLT (e.g., Geth for Ethereum, Bitcoin Core for
Bitcoin). The Mesh implementation communicates directly with this node
to read chain data and broadcast transactions.

A suite of tools to support development:

\- mesh-cli: A command-line tool to test and validate a Mesh
implementation's compliance with the specification.

\- mesh-sdk-go: An SDK to accelerate the development of Mesh
implementations in Golang.

The standard deployment model involves packaging the **Mesh**
**Implementation** and the corresponding **Blockchain** **Node**
together in a single Docker container to ensure tight coupling and
operational consistency.

> An implementation's internal logic typically consists of several
> packages from the mesh-sdk-go:
>
> **Syncer:** Fetches and processes blocks from the node.
>
> **Parser:** Interprets block data into the standardized Mesh models.
>
> **Storage:** Persists indexed data, often using memory-mapped files
> and compression (e.g., Zstandard) for efficiency.
>
> **Server:** Exposes the Mesh API endpoints.
>
> **Data** **Models** **&** **Specifications**

The source of truth for all Mesh data models and API definitions is the
coinbase/mesh-specifications GitHub repository. The specifications are

> written in the **OpenAPI** **3.0** format, which allows for automatic
> generation of client and server code.

> **Core** **Data** **Model** **Principles:**

>
> **Extensibility:** The metadata field is available in many objects to

> standard.
>
> **Clarity:** Enumerated types are used for critical fields, such as

A separate process or thread that queries Mesh for transaction statuses
and POSTs updates to client-registered URLs. Requires a small database
(e.g., Redis, PostgreSQL) to store subscriptions and job states.

Hosted in a container, co-located with its full node as recommended by
the Mesh standard.

**Overledger** **(/preparation/transaction)**

location

**Mesh** **(/construction/payloads)**

network_identifier

**Transformation** **Logic**

The connector uses the location object to select the correct Mesh
endpoint and construct the network_identifier.

**Overledger** **(/preparation/transaction)**

type (e.g., "Payment")

origin\[\].address

**Mesh** **(/construction/payloads)**

operations (array of Operation)

operations\[0\].account

**Transformation** **Logic**

An Overledger "Payment" maps to a single Mesh Operation of type:
"TRANSFER".

Mapped to the account.address field in the Mesh Operation.

The amount is mapped directly. The
destination\[\].payment.amountoperations\[0\].amount.value currency
object is constructed based on

1\. **Client** **-\>** **Connector:** Client sends a POST

3\. **Connector** **-\>** **Mesh:** Forwards the request to the Mesh

4\. **Mesh** **-\>** **Connector:** Mesh returns a
TransactionIdentifierResponse.

**Layer**

**Transaction** **Layer**

**Messaging** **Layer**

**Filtering** **&** **Ordering** **Layer**

**Application** **Layer**

**Function**

Interfaces directly with various DLTs, storing transactions that are
appended to the native ledger technologies.

Abstracts and retrieves relevant information (transaction data, smart
contract state, metadata) from all connected ledgers into a standardized
format.

Validates, filters, and orders messages from the Messaging Layer. It
establishes connections between transactions across different ledgers to
enable cross-chain logic.

Manages application-specific messages that have been validated and
ordered, ensuring they conform to the required format and signature
requirements of the mDApp.

Creates a webhook to monitor for specific events emitted by a smart
contract.

Creates a webhook to monitor for incoming or outgoing transactions for a
specific blockchain account/address.

Lists all existing webhooks for the application. Retrieves the details
of a specific webhook. Updates the configuration of an existing webhook.

Deletes a specified webhook.

**Smart** **Contract** **Interaction** **Model** When reading from or
writing to smart contracts on Ethereum-based networks, the API requires
parameters to be

> defined according to their Solidity types.
>
> **Supported** **Types**:
>
> **Basic**: uint, int (all sizes), string, address, bool, bytes (all
> sizes)
>
> **Arrays**: Dynamic (uint\[\]) and Fixed (uint\[4\]) arrays are
> supported for all basic types.

**Request** **Structure**: A request to call a smart contract function
requires specifying the function name and an array of input parameters,
each

with a defined type and value.

**Response** **Structure**: The response contains an array of output
objects, each specifying the type and the returned value.

**Abstraction** **is** **the** **Core** **Value**: Overledger’s primary
strength is abstracting away protocol-specific complexities. Developers
write to one

standardized API, and Overledger handles the translation and execution
across supported DLTs.

**Event-Driven** **Architecture**: The emphasis on Webhooks (V3) over
polling (V2) promotes a modern, efficient, and scalable event-driven

architecture for mDApps.

**Documentation** **Gap**: While the platform's capabilities are
well-documented conceptually, **detailed** **technical**
**documentation,** **including**

**comprehensive** **endpoint** **specifications,** **raw** **API**
**request/response** **examples** **(e.g.,** **cURL),** **and**
**complete** **data** **schemas,** **is** **not**

**publicly** **available.** Access to the official **Quant**
**Developer** **Hub** is required for deep integration work.

**Low-Code** **Integration**: The existence of official (though
archived) Make and Zapier integrations demonstrates a strategic focus on
enabling

low-code and no-code automation, broadening the potential user base
beyond expert blockchain developers.

> **Focus** **on** **Enterprise** **and** **RWA**: The support for

> **Quant** **Overledger:** **Technical** **Overview**

This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the Quant
Overledger platform, synthesized from the official documentation. It
covers

> core concepts, API references, data models, and interaction flows
> necessary for development.
>
> **1.** **Core** **Concepts**
>
> Overledger is a blockchain-agnostic API gateway that enables
> interoperability between different Distributed Ledger Technologies
> (DLTs). It provides a
>
> single, standardized interface to interact with multiple blockchains
> without requiring developers to run their own nodes or write
> chain-specific code.
>
> **Single** **API** **for** **All** **DLTs:** Overledger abstracts the
> complexities of individual blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP
> Ledger) into a unified
>
> REST API.
>
> **Transaction** **Interoperability:** It facilitates the creation,
> signing, and execution of transactions across supported networks.
>
> **Data** **Querying:** Provides standardized endpoints to search for
> transactions, addresses, blocks, and smart contract states across
> different
>
> ledgers.
>
> **Security** **Model:** The platform is designed so that private keys
> never leave the client's environment. Transactions are prepared by
> Overledger,
>
> signed by the client, and then submitted for execution.
>
> A critical component in every API call is the location object, which
> specifies the target DLT for the operation.

> 1\. Architecture Overview
>
> Quant Overledger is an enterprise-grade platform designed to provide
> interoperability between different Distributed Ledger Technologies
> (DLTs). Its
>
> architecture is built to abstract the complexities of individual
> blockchains, offering a single, unified API for developers.
>
> **Core** **Architectural** **Pillars:**
>
> **Multi-Chain** **Interoperability:** Enables seamless transactions
> and data exchange across a variety of public and private DLTs without
> requiring
>
> direct integration with each one.
>
> **Standardized** **API** **Layer:** Provides a consistent set of APIs
> for common blockchain operations, such as transaction creation, smart
> contract
>
> execution, and token management.
>
> **Scalability** **&** **Security:** Designed for high-throughput,
> enterprise-level use cases with a strong focus on security and secure
> key management.
>
> **Developer** **Friendliness:** Simplifies blockchain development by
> eliminating the need for specialized knowledge of disparate DLT
> protocols.
>
> **Quant** **Connect:** A deployment component that facilitates the
> connection of applications to the Overledger network.
>
> The typical workflow for interacting with Overledger, especially for
> state-changing operations, follows a **Prepare** **-\>** **Sign**
> **-\>** **Execute** pattern. This
>
> ensures that the transaction is correctly formatted by Overledger
> (Prepare), securely signed by the client (Sign), and then submitted
> for execution
>
> (Execute).
>
> 2\. Authentication Methods
>
> Overledger employs a multi-faceted approach to authentication and
> authorization, depending on the API being used. The primary methods
> observed
>
> are Bearer Token authentication for general API access and a
> sophisticated payload encryption mechanism for the sensitive Authorise
> API.
>
> 2.1. Bearer Token (OAuth2 / JWT)
>
> For most standard API endpoints, such as preparing a transaction,
> Overledger uses an OAuth2 Bearer Token.
>
> **Process:** Clients must first obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT) by
> authenticating with their credentials.
>
> **Endpoint:** The token is generated via a dedicated endpoint, likely
> POST /oauth2-token (Note: This endpoint was inaccessible during the
>
> data gathering phase).
>
> **Usage:** The obtained token is then passed in the Authorization
> header for subsequent API calls.
>
> Authorization: Bearer \<YOUR_JWT_TOKEN\>
>
> 2.2. Authorise API (Payload Encryption)
>
> For highly sensitive operations like user management, key creation,
> and transaction signing, the Authorise API mandates a robust
> end-to-end
>
> encryption scheme. This ensures that the payload is unreadable by any
> intermediary, including Quant.
>
> **Encryption** **Flow:**
>
> 1\. **Generate** **Symmetric** **Key:** Create a random 128-bit AES

>
> 3\. **Encrypt** **Symmetric** **Key:** Encrypt the AES key from step 1
> using a provided RSA public key.
>
> 4\. **Send** **Request:** Make the API call, passing the encrypted

>
> **1.** **Background** **and** **Rationale**
>
> A comprehensive investigation into integrating Quant Overledger with
> Coinbase Mesh confirmed the technical feasibility of a full-scale
> connector. The
>
> analysis highlighted a strong architectural alignment, particularly in
> the Prepare -\> Sign -\> Execute transaction lifecycle.

> **Operational** **Overhead:** The requirement to self-host a full DLT
> node for each Mesh implementation presents considerable resource and
>
> maintenance challenges.
>
> **Documentation** **Gaps:** Key areas, particularly around complex
> smart contract interactions (/construction/payloads), are poorly
>
> documented, introducing implementation risks.
>
> **Ecosystem** **Maturity:** Coinbase Mesh has limited community
> adoption and publicly available resources, which could hinder
> development and
>
> troubleshooting.
>
> Given these findings, a full-scale development effort is premature. A
> targeted, limited-scope **Proof-of-Concept** **(PoC)** is the most
> prudent path
>
> forward. This PoC will validate the core translation logic for
> fundamental operations and provide tangible data on the operational
> challenges of the
>
> Mesh ecosystem before a larger investment is considered.
>
> **2.** **Proof-of-Concept** **Objectives**
>
> The primary objectives of this PoC are:
>
> 1\. **Validate** **Core** **Functionality:** Prove the technical
> feasibility of translating fundamental Quant Overledger read (account
> balance) and write
>
> (asset transfer) API calls into the corresponding Coinbase Mesh API
> format.
>
> 2\. **De-Risk** **Key** **Assumptions:** Directly address the major
> risks identified in the initial investigation by implementing the
> Prepare -\> Execute
>
> flow and documenting the real-world effort required to set up and
> manage a Mesh node instance.
>
> 3\. **Produce** **a** **Functional** **Artifact:** Deliver a working,
> stateless middleware connector that can serve as a technical
> foundation and a
>
> demonstrable asset for stakeholders.
>
> 4\. **Formulate** **a** **Data-Driven** **Recommendation:** Conclude
> the PoC with a clear Go/No-Go recommendation for a full-scale project,
> supported by
>
> empirical evidence and a detailed analysis of the challenges
> encountered.
>
> **3.** **Scope** **Definition**
>
> To maintain focus and ensure rapid delivery, the scope is strictly
> defined as follows:

**In** **Scope** **Out** **of** **Scope**

**Connector** **Middleware** **Service:** A stateless service that
translates **Production** **Deployment:** The connector specific API
calls. production use.

**Single** **DLT** **Network:** Implementation will target a single
EVM-based network (e.g., Ethereum) using a standard Mesh reference
implementation.

**API** **Function** **1** **(Read):** Implement get account balance
translation.

**API** **Functions** **2** **&** **3** **(Write):** Implement the
prepare transfer and execute transfer transaction flow.

**Local** **Node** **Deployment:** The PoC will involve deploying and
connecting to a self-hosted DLT node and Mesh instance.

**External** **Signing:** The PoC assumes transaction signing occurs
outside the connector (e.g., via Overwallet), focusing solely on the
prepare and execute steps.

**Multi-Network** **Support:** The PoC will not support multiple DLTs or
dynamic connector registration.

**Complex** **Reads:** No support for block, transaction, or smart
contract data queries.

**Complex** **Writes:** No support for smart contract function calls or
NFT operations.

**User** **Interface** **(UI):** No UI will be developed; interaction
will be API-based.

**Managed** **Signing** **Services:** The connector will not manage
private keys or signing processes.

> **4.** **Success** **Criteria**
>
> The PoC will be deemed successful upon meeting the following criteria:
>
> 1\. **Successful** **Read** **Operation:** An API call to the
> connector for an account balance is successfully translated, sent to
> the Mesh API, and returns
>
> the correct balance from the underlying ledger.
>
> 2\. **Successful** **Write** **Operation:** A prepared and signed
> asset transfer transaction is successfully submitted through the
> connector to the Mesh
>
> API, resulting in a verifiable on-chain state change.
>
> 3\. **Validated** **Translation** **Logic:** The connector correctly
> decomposes Quant Overledger's high-level intent (Payment) into the
> granular, atomic
>
> TRANSFER operations required by Coinbase Mesh, as verified through
> logging and testing.
>
> 4\. **Comprehensive** **Final** **Report:** A final report is
> delivered, containing:
>
> A demonstration of the working PoC.
>
> A detailed summary of challenges, particularly concerning node setup
> and Mesh API ambiguities.

application built for

> Quant Overledger and a target blockchain network exposed via a
> Coinbase Mesh-compliant API.

>
> **Component** **Responsibility** **Key** **Functions**

> **Quant** **API** **Adapter**

Exposes Quant Overledger-compatible API endpoints.

\- Receives incoming HTTP requests (/v2/preparation/\*,
/v2/execution/\*).

\- Validates request schemas against Overledger specifications.

\- Orchestrates the internal workflow by calling other components.

> **Data**
>
> **Mapper** **&** The core translation engine. **Transformer**

\- Maps Overledger data models to Mesh data models.

\- Translates high-level Overledger intents (e.g., mint a tokenName)
into low-level Mesh Operation arrays.

\- Utilizes a **Token** **Definition** **Registry** to resolve tokenName
to contract details.

> **Mesh** **API** **Client**
>
> **State** **Manager**

Manages all communication with the downstream Mesh implementation.

Manages the transient state required for the multi-step transaction
flow.

\- Constructs and sends requests to Mesh endpoints
(/construction/payloads, /construction/combine, /construction/submit).

\- Handles HTTP-level concerns like headers, timeouts, and retries.

\- Generates a unique requestId for each prepare call. - Caches the
mapping between the requestId and the unsigned_transaction received from
Mesh.

\- Uses a time-to-live (TTL) cache (e.g., Redis, in-memory cache) to
store this state.

> **Token** **Definition** **Registry**

\- Provides the contractAddress, functionSignature, and parameter A
configurable lookup service details needed to translate an Overledger
tokenName into a Mesh for token information. - Can be implemented as a
simple configuration file (YAML/JSON)

\- Implement an **exponential** **backoff** **retry** mechanism (e.g., 3
retries over 15 seconds).

\- If all retries fail, return a 503 Service Unavailable to the client.
Log the failure critically.

This indicates a bug in the connector's **Data** **Transformer**. Log

Mesh /submit endpoint returns an error from the DLT (e.g., "insufficient
funds", "bad nonce").

Forward the specific DLT error message to the client within a 400 Bad
Request or 500 Internal Server Error response, depending on the error
type. Log the error.

**Term**

**Operation**

**Definition**

An atomic, indivisible action intended to alter the state of a ledger,
such as a value transfer or a smart contract function call. A
transaction may contain one or more Operations.

**Transaction** A signed data package containing one or more Operations,
broadcast to a network for inclusion in

**Identifier**

**Metadata**

**Payload** **to** **Sign**

A standardized object used to uniquely identify an on-chain entity, such
as an Account, Block, or Transaction.

Supplemental, structured data attached to a primary object (e.g., an
Operation or Transaction) that provides additional context not part of
the core protocol definition.

A data structure representing the cryptographic message that a user must
sign with their private key to authorize a transaction.

> **3.** **Core** **Principles**
>
> The design of this standard is guided by the following principles:
>
> **Client-Side** **Security:** The transaction lifecycle *must*
> separate transaction preparation from signing, ensuring that private
> keys never leave the
>
> control of the end-user.
>
> **Explicit** **State** **Changes:** Transactions are modeled as a
> collection of Operation objects, making every intended state change
> explicit and
>
> auditable.
>
> **Structured** **Extensibility:** The model must be extensible to
> support future DLTs and custom features without compromising the core
> standard.
>
> This is achieved via a formal metadata schema.
>
> **Abstraction** **and** **Simplicity:** While granular, the model aims
> to abstract away the most complex, chain-specific details into a
> consistent
>
> interface, simplifying development.
>
> **4.** **Data** **Model** **Specification**
>
> **4.1.** **Core** **Identifiers**
>
> Identifiers are fundamental to locating resources on a ledger.

**Identifier**

**NetworkIdentifier**

**AccountIdentifier**

**BlockIdentifier**

**Structure**

{ "blockchain": "string", "network": "string" }

{ "address": "string", "sub_account": { "address": "string" },
"metadata": {} }

{ "index": "integer", "hash": "string" }

**Rationale**

Explicitly defines the target ledger (e.g., "Ethereum", "Mainnet").
Essential for routing in a multi-chain environment.

Formally separates the primary address from sub-account identifiers
(e.g., memo/destination tags), a common requirement in UTXO and other
models.

Allows for block lookup by either height or hash, providing flexibility.

**TransactionIdentifier**{ "hash": "string" } The unique, on-chain hash
of an executed transaction.

**Design** **Choice**

**Explicit** **Operation** **Model**

**Structured** **Smart** **Contract** **Metadata**

**Justification**

Provides an unambiguous, auditable breakdown of all transaction effects.
Eliminates the need for developers to parse opaque, chain-specific data
payloads to understand what a transaction did.

Standardizes the way smart contract calls are prepared, defining a clear
schema for function names, signatures, and parameters. This greatly
simplifies one of the most complex aspects of DLT development.

**Addresses** **Weakness** **In**

**Quant** **Overledger:** Replaces the "black box" nativeData with a
transparent, standardized structure.

**Coinbase** **Mesh:** Solves the problem of the poorly documented and
overly generic /call and /construction/payloads endpoints.

**Design** **Choice**

**Justification** **Addresses** **Weakness** **In**

> Promotes a scalable, real-time, and resource-efficient architecture
> for monitoring on-chain activity. This is superior to legacy polling
> methods, which are slow and create unnecessary network load.
>
> Enforces a secure-by-design workflow where private keys are never
> exposed to the interoperability service. The explicit combine step
> adds transparency to the transaction construction process.

Creates a universal vocabulary (AccountIdentifier, **Standardized**
Currency, etc.) that reduces ambiguity and makes it easier
**Primitives** to write code that works across multiple DLTs without

> modification.

**Coinbase** **Mesh:** Integrates a first-class eventing system, a
feature largely absent from the core Mesh specification.

**Both:** Formalizes and refines the best security practices seen across
both platforms into a clear, mandatory lifecycle.

**Both:** Synthesizes the cleanest concepts from each platform into a
single, coherent set of primitives.
